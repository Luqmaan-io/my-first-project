# About Saira's Treats
Saira's Treats is a website for a already established small business for my wife who bakes part-time but at a professioanl level. Right now the website is in its very basic form with there currently being 3 current sections. 

This project is the first of mine and has allowed me to explore my HTML and CSS skills as well as learning about Bootsrap - the first library i've explored.

# Site contents
- Home Page. A litte introduction into what Saira's treats is and what she does.
- Occasions Page. Describes to site visitors the different types of occasions she caters for.
- Enquiries Page. Presents a form for site visitors to fill in if they wished to make an enquiry to Saira's treats regarding a bake.


# Project Purpose
The purpose of this project is to showcase and promote handmade baked cakes and other goods. The focus is primarily on bespoke cakes whilst also providing an easy, elegant way for customers to enquire about an order (and in a later version, to be able to place orders online).
